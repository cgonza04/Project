#Description
#1. Control (only growth medium):100% H2O2 (it is our reference)
#2. Cu 6.4mg/L: 140%
#3. Cu 6.4mg/L +10-DOC_AN: 140 %, same group as only Cu
#4. Cu 6.4mg/L +100-DOC_AN: 170%
#5. 100-DOC_AN: 100%, same group as control

#Putting pure Cu or putting a mix Cu +10 AN leaf extract have the same
#effect, they increase lipid peroxidation in Lemna minor  (Trt 2 and 3).
# And as the concentarion of extract increases into 100 NA + Cu, 
#it increases the MDA concentration as compare to the control: 
# a lot of leaf extracts have a big impact on lipid peroxidation, which means 
#Adding only leaf extracts doesn't makes a significant difference from the 
#control (they are in the same group)
#
#Interpretation:
##Lipid peroxidation is a sign of stress, it is oxidative damage that affects 
#cellular membranes, lipoproteins, and other molecules that contain lipids 
#in conditions with oxidative stress

#Description
#1. Control (only growth medium):100% Lipid (it is our reference)
#2. Cu 6.4mg/L: 200%
#3. Cu 6.4mg/L +10-DOC_AG: 140 %

#5. 100-DOC_AG: 120% a little inferior to 100%, in a
#significantly different group from the control

#Interpretation
#Putting pure Cu increases the lipid peroxidation significantly i.e. by 100%.
#Increase in concentration of AG in the mixture of Cu and AG increases the 
#lipid peroxidation.
#Lipid peroxidation is 60% more in Cu + 100 Ag than in Cu + 10 Ag.
#Adding only leaf extracts doesn't make a significant difference from the 
#control (Trt 1 and 5)
