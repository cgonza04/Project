Good job.

Your project is well written and the rmd runs almost perfectly (there is a small mistake: there should be no space between "<" and "https" in the link, for it to work right).

 

Some indications about it:

 

- In your Hypothesis 1, you should explain why by random you expect H0 to be lower or equal instead of only equal. The same issue occurs with Hypothesis 2. I do not know why before the experiment do you expect to have differences between the two species.
DONE
 

- 1. The article and the data are interesting, but data are messy, separated in several tables and not well explained with Metadata. Therefore, your first step should be to import all the data in one or more data frames, carefully from links 
DONE

and explain what each variable means. For this you can use the article.

 

- For the treatment variables, I would separate the treatment variable in two or three different treatment variables. The first one for Cu present or absent and the second one for the Organic Matter concentration from each species. Try different approaches and choose the one you think represent better the results.

 

- I would not start directly with a Manova. I advise you first to plot your results and do direct one or two way anovas for each dependent variable (as they do in the article). After knowing this results they might be better modeled with a manova.

 

- For Post-Hoc comparisons use the Tukey test and compare the results with the used Dunne test. Â¿Why do they use this test instead of the most usual?.

 

- With all the chemical activity data, after doing the direct analysis, you should put all those data together and try a multivariate analysis. A good tutorial for this is: http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/31-principal-component-methods-in-r-practical-guide/118-principal-component-analysis-in-r-prcomp-vs-princomp/

For this analysis it probably is more work to put the data in the right shape that doing the analyses. From this analysis you can see how the chemical activity groups and if this grouping can be explained by the treatments.

 

Remember that for any questions you can use the forum in PoliformaT.
